# Reusable AES Diagram Components

This is a repository of resuable AWS cloud architecture diagram components.  This repository is maintained by AWS Community Builders and is not officially supported by AWS in any way.

## Contribution Guidelines

The workflow will be similar to the [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow), but working only on the main branch.

Each pattern should be represented in its own folder, which contains the pattern in an editable format (e.g., .drawio, .visx, .archi), a PNG version, and a readme.md file which briefly describes the pattern and displays the PNG.  Usually one pattern is contained in a folder, but slight variations of the same pattern can be groupd together.  The readme should then include dicussion of all the patterns, and what the differeces between them.  Also, do not contribute anything your employer or client considers secret.
